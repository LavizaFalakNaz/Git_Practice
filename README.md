# LEARNING GIT

This is a git practice repository i've created to practice Git and help juniors follow a very simple pathway towards professional software development.

# INSTALLING GIT

- [ ] goto https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the setup

- [ ] run the setup and choose all the default options (TRUST ME, THEY'RE THE BEST ONES FOR BEGINNERS AND PROFESSIONALS TOO!)

- [ ] once installed, search for "GIT GUI" on windows search option. you should see a repository

- [ ] now you need to link this VCS (Version Control System) with an application like GitHub! (And Whoosh, by default you alread prepared it to link to a github account!)

# BASIC GIT COMMANDS

open powershell and run the following commands
Create a new test directory (folder) by entering the following:
```
mkdir git_test
```
### Change your location to the newly created directory:
```
cd git_test
```
### Configure GitHub Credentials
```
git config ––global user.name “github_username”
git config ––global user.email “email_address”
```
### Clone a GitHub Repository
```
git clone <em>repository_url</em>
```
### List Remote Repositories
```
cd git_project
```
### list the remote repositories:
```
git remote –v
```
### Pushing Local Files to the Remote Repository

1. For example, create a new text file by entering the following into your PowerShell window:
```
new-item text.txt
```
2. Confirmation that the new file is created.

Create new text file in Windows PowerShell.

3. Now check the status of your new Git branch and untracked files:
```
git status
```
4. Add your new file to the local project:
```
git add text.txt
```
5. Run git status again to make sure the text.txt file has been added. Next, commit the changes to the local project:
```
git commit –m “Sample 1”
```
6. Finally, push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:
```
git push
```
You may need to enter your username and password for GitHub.
